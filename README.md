# 🛡️ Bannan Haverty | Aspiring Cybersecurity Professional

Transitioning from a 10-year military career to cybersecurity.

I bring a decade of discipline, problem-solving, and mission-focused experience from the British Army, now channelled into defending digital landscapes. Over the past year, I’ve been building my technical foundation in IT and cybersecurity, earning the CompTIA Security+ certification and working toward Network+, CySA+, and CREST CPSA.
